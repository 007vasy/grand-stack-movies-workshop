# React & Apollo(Client)

## React

## Apollo Client

# Exercise

![](../img/webappoverview-reqs.png)

We start with a simple React app that was created using the [create-react-app]() template. This React app has the following components:

// TODO: image showing app and individual component overlay

* **App** -
* **Movie** -
* **MovieList** -
* **MovieSearch** -


One major thing missing from this skeleton app is real data.

The goal for this exercise is to update the React app to use Apollo Client and query our GraphQL API.
